!!! note
    We released kintone UI Component version 1.0.0 on 04 March 2021.
    If you want to use it, please check <a target="_blank" href="https://kintone-ui-component.netlify.app/">this website</a> for details.
    (Now it's only available in Japanese. We will also support English documents in near future.)

    With the release of v1, we will continue to mainly fix bugs and update libraries for v0.  We don't plan to develop new functions for now.
